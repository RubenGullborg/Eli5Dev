## What is an Algorithm?

An algorithm is a set of well-defined instructions designed to perform a specific task or solve a particular problem. It takes input data, processes it through a sequence of steps, and produces an output.

## Simple Analogy

Think of an algorithm like a cooking recipe:

1. A recipe starts with ingredients (the input)
2. Provides step-by-step instructions (the process)
3. Results in a finished dish (the output)

Just as different recipes exist to make the same dish (some more efficient or tastier than others), different algorithms can solve the same problem with varying levels of efficiency.

## Key Concepts

- **Time Complexity**: How the running time increases as the input size grows
- **Space Complexity**: How much memory is required as the input size grows
- **Optimization**: Improving algorithms to be faster or use less memory
- **Common Types**: Sorting (arranging data), searching (finding data), graph algorithms (finding paths), etc.

## Example

Here's a simple algorithm for finding the largest number in a list:

```javascript
function findLargestNumber(numbers) {
  // Start by assuming the first number is the largest
  let largest = numbers[0];
  
  // Check each number in the list
  for (let i = 1; i < numbers.length; i++) {
    // If the current number is larger than our current "largest"
    if (numbers[i] > largest) {
      // Update our "largest" to be this number
      largest = numbers[i];
    }
  }
  
  // Return the largest number we found
  return largest;
}
```
