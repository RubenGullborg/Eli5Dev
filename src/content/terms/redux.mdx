## What is Redux?

Redux is a predictable state management library for JavaScript applications, commonly used with frameworks like React. It maintains the entire application state in a single, centralized store, making state changes traceable and predictable through a one-way data flow.

## Simple Analogy

Think of Redux like a well-organized bank:

- **The Vault (Store)**: A single, secure location where all the money (state data) is kept. You can't directly access the vault or modify its contents.

- **Bank Tellers (Reducers)**: Staff who perform specific operations on the money in the vault. They take your request, the current state of the vault, and produce a new state.

- **Transaction Slips (Actions)**: Standardized forms that customers fill out to request operations. Each slip has a type (deposit, withdrawal, etc.) and the necessary information to process the transaction.

- **Bank Manager (Dispatcher)**: The person who receives your transaction slip and ensures it gets to the appropriate teller.

When you want to deposit money (update state):
1. You fill out a transaction slip (create an action)
2. Hand it to the manager (dispatch the action)
3. The manager directs it to the correct teller (calls the reducer)
4. The teller processes your request against the current vault state
5. The teller updates the vault with the new state

This process ensures that all financial transactions (state changes) are documented, follow a standard procedure, and maintain the integrity of the vault (store).

## Key Concepts

- **Store**: The single source of truth that holds the entire state of the application
- **Actions**: Plain JavaScript objects that describe what happened (type property is required)
- **Reducers**: Pure functions that specify how the state changes in response to actions
- **Dispatch**: The method used to send actions to the store
- **Selectors**: Functions that extract specific pieces of data from the store
- **Middleware**: Optional extensions between dispatching an action and reaching the reducer

## Example

```javascript
// Action Types
const INCREMENT = 'INCREMENT';
const DECREMENT = 'DECREMENT';

// Action Creators
const increment = () => ({ type: INCREMENT });
const decrement = () => ({ type: DECREMENT });

// Initial State
const initialState = { count: 0 };

// Reducer
function counterReducer(state = initialState, action) {
  switch (action.type) {
    case INCREMENT:
      return { count: state.count + 1 };
    case DECREMENT:
      return { count: state.count - 1 };
    default:
      return state;
  }
}

// Create Store
const { createStore } = Redux;
const store = createStore(counterReducer);

// Subscribe to store updates
store.subscribe(() => console.log(store.getState()));

// Dispatch actions
store.dispatch(increment()); // Logs: { count: 1 }
store.dispatch(increment()); // Logs: { count: 2 }
store.dispatch(decrement()); // Logs: { count: 1 }
