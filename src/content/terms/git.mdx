## What is Git?

Git is a system that records changes to a file or set of files over time so that you can recall specific versions later. It allows multiple people to work together on the same project without overwriting each other's changes.

## Simple Analogy

Think of Git like the "Track Changes" feature in a word processor, but much more powerful and built for code. 

Every time you reach a good point in your work (like finishing a feature or fixing a bug), you take a "snapshot" (a commit). Git stores these snapshots efficiently.

If you make a mistake, you can easily rewind back to a previous snapshot. If multiple people are working, Git helps merge everyone's snapshots together intelligently.

It's like having an infinite "Undo" button for your entire project, shared across your whole team.

## Key Concepts

*   **Repository (Repo):** A folder containing your project files and the `.git` directory where Git stores the history.
*   **Commit:** A snapshot of your files at a specific point in time.
*   **Branch:** A separate line of development. You can create branches to work on new features without affecting the main codebase.
*   **Merge:** Combining changes from different branches back together.
*   **Clone:** Creating a local copy of a remote repository (like one on GitHub).
*   **Push:** Sending your local commits to a remote repository.
*   **Pull:** Fetching changes from a remote repository and merging them into your local copy.
