## What is CSS?

CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a style sheet used for describing the presentation of a document written in a markup language like HTML. CSS describes how elements should be rendered on screen. It is one of the core technologies of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and JavaScript.

## Simple Analogy

Think of CSS like a fashion designer for a website:
<br/>
- **HTML**: Like a mannequin - it provides the basic structure
<br/>
- **CSS**: Like a fashion designer who:
  - Picks the colors and patterns (colors, backgrounds)
  - Decides the size and fit (dimensions, spacing)
  - Chooses the accessories (borders, shadows)
  - Creates different looks for different occasions (media queries)
  - Maintains a consistent style guide (CSS variables)

## Key Concepts

- **Selectors**: Patterns used to select the element(s) you want to style
- **Properties**: The actual styles you want to apply (color, size, position, etc.)
- **Values**: The specific settings for each property
- **Grid**: A two-dimensional layout system for arranging items in rows and columns
- **Media Queries**: Rules for applying different styles based on device characteristics

## Example

```css
/* Basic styling */
.website-header {
  background-color: #2c3e50;
  color: white;
  padding: 20px;
  font-family: Arial, sans-serif;
}

/* Responsive design */
@media (max-width: 768px) {
  .website-header {
    padding: 10px;
    font-size: 14px;
  }
}

/* Modern layout with Flexbox */
.content-container {
  display: flex;
  justify-content: space-between;
  gap: 20px;
}

/* Hover effects */
.button {
  background-color: #3498db;
  color: white;
  padding: 10px 20px;
  border-radius: 5px;
  transition: background-color 0.3s;
}

.button:hover {
  background-color: #2980b9;
}
```
