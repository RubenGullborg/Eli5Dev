## What is CSS?

CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a styling language used to describe the presentation of a document written in HTML. It controls how web pages look in the browser - everything from colors and fonts to layouts and animations.

## Simple Analogy

If HTML is the skeleton of a webpage (the structure), then CSS is the skin, clothing, and makeup (the appearance). 

Think of it like dressing up a mannequin. The mannequin itself (HTML) defines the basic shape and structure, but the clothes, accessories, and styling (CSS) determine how it actually looks to people viewing it. You can completely change the appearance without changing the underlying structure.

## Key Concepts

- **Selectors**: Target specific HTML elements to apply styles to
- **Properties**: Visual aspects you want to change (like color, font-size, margin)
- **Values**: Specific settings for properties (like red, 16px, 10px)
- **Cascade**: Rules for determining which styles take precedence when multiple styles apply
- **Box Model**: How elements are sized with content, padding, border, and margin

## Example

```css
/* Target all paragraph elements */
p {
  color: navy;
  font-size: 16px;
  line-height: 1.5;
  margin-bottom: 20px;
}

/* Target elements with a specific class */
.highlight {
  background-color: yellow;
  font-weight: bold;
}
```
