question: "A language that lets you ask questions to a database and get answers back?"
hint: "This language helps you find, add, change, or remove information stored in a database, like asking a librarian to find a specific book."
analogy: "Think of SQL like talking to a librarian. The library (database) has many books (data) organized in different sections (tables). When you want to find a book, you ask the librarian (using SQL) something like 'Can you find me all the mystery books written by Stephen King?' The librarian knows exactly where to look and brings back just the books you asked for. SQL works the same way - it's a simple language that lets you ask questions to a database and get back exactly the information you need."

## What is SQL?

SQL is a simple language for talking to databases. It lets you ask questions, add new information, change existing information, or remove information from a database. Think of it like giving instructions to a librarian who knows exactly where everything is stored.

## Simple Analogy

Think of a database as a digital library, and SQL as the language you use to talk to the librarian:
<br/>
- **Database**: A digital library with many organized sections
- **Tables**: Different sections of the library (like fiction, non-fiction, children's books)
- **Rows**: Individual books or records
- **Columns**: Information about each book (like title, author, year published)
- **SQL Commands**: Questions or instructions you give to the librarian
<br/>
When you need information, instead of searching through the entire library yourself, you ask the librarian (using SQL):
<br/>
- "Please find all books by Stephen King" becomes:
<br/>
  ```sql
  SELECT * FROM Books WHERE author = 'Stephen King';
  ```
<br/>
- "Find all mystery books published after 2010" becomes:
<br/>
  ```sql
  SELECT title, author FROM Books 
  WHERE genre = 'Mystery' AND year_published > 2010;
  ```

## Key Concepts

- **Tables**: Where data is stored in rows and columns
- **Queries**: Questions you ask to get specific information
- **Data Types**: Different kinds of information (text, numbers, dates)
- **Primary Keys**: Unique identifiers for each row, like a book's ISBN or a person's social security number
- **Foreign Keys**: Connections between different tables, a book might have foreign keys to both authors and publishers
- **Joins**: Combining information from multiple tables, based on keys

## Example

```sql
-- Create a table for storing books
CREATE TABLE Books (
  id INT PRIMARY KEY,
  title VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
  author VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
  year_published INT
);

-- Add a new book to the table
INSERT INTO Books (id, title, author, year_published) 
VALUES (1, 'The Shining', 'Stephen King', 1977);

-- Find all books by a specific author
SELECT title, year_published 
FROM Books 
WHERE author = 'Stephen King';
```
