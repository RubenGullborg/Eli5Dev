title: "DevOps"
description: "A set of practices that combines software development (Dev) and IT operations (Ops) to shorten the development lifecycle while delivering features, fixes, and updates frequently and reliably."
question: "What practice aims to break down the barriers between developers and operations teams to enable faster, more reliable software delivery?"
hint: "It's a combination of two words that represent the teams it brings together."
analogy: "DevOps is like a restaurant where the chefs (developers) and waitstaff (operations) work together as one team instead of staying in separate areas. In a traditional restaurant, chefs cook food and throw it over a wall for waiters to serve, leading to problems: chefs don't know if customers like the food, and waiters can't explain cooking issues to customers. In a DevOps restaurant, chefs and waiters collaborate constantly - chefs sometimes serve food to understand customer reactions, waiters sometimes help in the kitchen to understand the cooking process, and both groups meet regularly to improve the menu and service together. This results in better food, happier customers, and fewer errors."

## What is DevOps?

DevOps is a way of working where the people who build software (developers) and the people who run and maintain it (operations) collaborate closely throughout the entire process.
<br/>
It emphasizes automation, communication, and breaking down traditional silos to deliver better software faster and more reliably.

## Simple Analogy

DevOps is like building and maintaining a house together:
<br/>
- **Traditional Approach**: Architects (developers) design a house and throw the blueprints over a wall to builders (operations). Architects never visit the construction site, and builders can't change the design even if they encounter problems. When something breaks later, it isn't clear who should fix it.
<br/>
- **DevOps Approach**: Architects and builders work together from day one. Architects visit the site regularly, builders give input on designs, and both groups create a maintenance plan together. They use power tools (automation) instead of manual labor when possible, and they build the house in sections (small deployments) so people can start living in it sooner and provide feedback.

## The DevOps Lifecycle

1. **Plan**: Define features and requirements
2. **Code**: Write and review code
3. **Build**: Compile and package code
4. **Test**: Automated testing
5. **Release**: Prepare for deployment
6. **Deploy**: Release to production
7. **Operate**: Run and monitor
8. **Monitor**: Collect data and feedback
9. **Repeat**: Start the cycle again


## Example

A team practicing DevOps might:
- Use Git for version control
- Automatically run tests whenever code is committed
- Deploy code to production multiple times per day
- Use monitoring tools to detect problems quickly
- Have developers participate in on-call rotations
- Hold regular retrospectives to continuously improve
