question: "How do we build big computer programs by breaking them into smaller, independent pieces?"
hint: "This architecture lets different teams work on different parts of a program independently, like a restaurant where each chef specializes in making one type of dish."
analogy: "Think of microservices like a restaurant kitchen. Instead of having one chef who does everything (cooking, cleaning, serving), you have many specialized workers: a pasta chef, a dessert chef, a dishwasher, and servers. Each person has their own job, and they work together to run the restaurant. If the pasta chef is busy, it doesn't stop the dessert chef from making desserts. And if you need to change how pasta is cooked, you only need to train the pasta chef, not everyone in the kitchen. Microservices work the same way - each small program has its own job, and they work together to run your big program."

## What are Microservices?

Microservices are a way of building big computer programs by breaking them into many small, independent programs. Each small program (called a microservice) does one specific job, and they all work together to run your big program. This is different from the old way, where everything was in one big program.

## Simple Analogy

Think of microservices like a restaurant kitchen:
<br/>
- **Old Way (Monolithic)**: One chef who does everything - cooking all dishes, washing dishes, serving customers. If this chef gets sick, the whole restaurant stops.
<br/>
- **Microservices Way**: Many specialized workers:
  - Pasta chef makes pasta
  - Dessert chef makes desserts
  - Dishwasher cleans dishes
  - Servers take orders and serve food
<br/>
Each person can work independently, and if one person is busy, it doesn't stop the others from doing their jobs.

## Key Concepts

- **Independent**: Each microservice can be built, tested, and run separately
- **Specialized**: Each microservice does one specific job really well
- **Communication**: Microservices talk to each other over the internet
- **Scalability**: You can make more copies of busy microservices when needed
- **Resilience**: If one microservice fails, the others keep working
- **Technology Choice**: Each microservice can use different programming languages and tools
