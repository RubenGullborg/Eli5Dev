## What is HTML?

HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the code used to structure a web page and its content. It consists of a series of elements, which you use to enclose, or wrap, different parts of the content to make it appear a certain way, or act a certain way.

## Simple Analogy

Think of HTML as the skeleton of a webpage. Just like your skeleton gives structure to your body, HTML provides the basic structure for everything you see on a website.

*   `<h1>` is like the sign for the main entrance (the main heading).
*   `<p>` is like a paragraph in a book (a block of text).
*   `<img>` is like hanging a picture frame on the wall (displaying an image).
*   `<a>` is like a doorway or a sign pointing to another room (a link).

CSS (like the paint, furniture, and decorations) makes the skeleton look good, and JavaScript (like electricity and plumbing) makes it functional and interactive, but HTML is the fundamental structure.

## Example

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <title>My Simple Page</title>
</head>
<body>

  <h1>Welcome to My Website!</h1>
  
  <p>This is a paragraph of text explaining something.</p>
  
  <img src="image.jpg" alt="A descriptive image">
  
  <a href="https://example.com">Click here to visit Example.com</a>

</body>
</html>
```
