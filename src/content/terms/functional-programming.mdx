title: "Functional Programming"
description: "A way of writing code that treats everything like a recipe - you put ingredients in, you get food out, but you never change the original ingredients."
question: "What way of writing code is like following a recipe - you never change the original ingredients?"
hint: "This style of programming creates new things instead of changing existing ones, like making a new sandwich instead of modifying someone else's."
analogy: "Think of Functional Programming like making sandwiches with a special rule: 'Never change someone else's sandwich!' Instead, if you want a sandwich with extra cheese, you make a completely new sandwich. This way, everyone knows exactly what's in their sandwich, and there's no confusion about who added what. It's like having a recipe book where each recipe tells you exactly what you'll get when you follow it - no surprises!"

## What is Functional Programming?

Functional Programming is like writing recipes for a kitchen where there's one important rule: never change the original ingredients!
<br/>
Instead of modifying things that already exist, you always create new things. It's like if you want a sandwich with extra cheese - instead of adding cheese to an existing sandwich, you make a whole new sandwich with cheese already in it.

## Simple Analogy

Think of Functional Programming like a special kitchen with one rule:
<br/>
- **Regular Programming**: Like a kitchen where everyone shares ingredients and changes them. If someone starts making a sandwich, another person might add more cheese, and a third person might add lettuce. Pretty soon, no one knows exactly what's in the sandwich!
<br/>
- **Functional Programming**: Like a kitchen where everyone follows one rule: **"Never change someone else's food!"**
  - If you want to add cheese to a sandwich, you make a completely new sandwich with cheese in it
  - The original sandwich stays exactly the same
  - Each recipe always makes the same food when you use the same ingredients

## Key Concepts

- **Pure Functions**: Like recipes that always make the same food when you use the same ingredients
- **Immutability**: Once you make something, you never change it - you always make something new instead
- **First-Class Functions**: Being able to use recipes as ingredients in other recipes
- **Function Composition**: Combining simple recipes to make more complicated ones

## Example

```javascript
// Regular way (changing things)
function addCheeseToSandwich(sandwich) {
  sandwich.cheese = true;  // Changes the original sandwich
  return sandwich;
}

let mySandwich = { bread: true, lettuce: true };
addCheeseToSandwich(mySandwich);
// Now mySandwich has cheese added to it


// Functional way (making new things)
function makeSandwichWithCheese(sandwich) {
  return {
    ...sandwich,  // Copy everything from the original sandwich
    cheese: true  // Add cheese to the new sandwich
  };
}

let originalSandwich = { bread: true, lettuce: true };
let newSandwich = makeSandwichWithCheese(originalSandwich);
// originalSandwich stays the same
// newSandwich is a new sandwich with cheese
```
