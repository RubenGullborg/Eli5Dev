## What is Blockchain?

Blockchain is a distributed, decentralized ledger technology that records transactions across many computers in a way that makes the records resistant to modification. Each block contains a list of transactions and a reference to the previous block, forming a chain of blocks that cannot be altered without changing all subsequent blocks and gaining consensus from the network.

## Simple Analogy

Think of blockchain like a physical ledger book with special properties:

- **Traditional Ledger**: In a traditional system, a single accountant might keep a financial ledger. If they make a mistake or deliberately change an entry, it can be hard to detect.

- **Blockchain Ledger**: Imagine instead that:
  1. Hundreds of people have identical copies of the ledger book
  2. Each page (block) contains transactions and a special stamp that includes the pattern from the previous page
  3. Every 10 minutes, a new page is created with new transactions
  4. Everyone compares their copies to ensure they're identical
  5. To change an old entry, you would need to:
     - Alter that page
     - Recreate the special stamp pattern
     - Change all subsequent pages and their stamps
     - Replace the majority of books in circulation without anyone noticing

This is practically impossible, making the blockchain extremely secure against tampering. Just as you can't change page 5 of a 100-page book without affecting pages 6-100, you can't alter a block in the blockchain without breaking the entire chain.

## Key Concepts

- **Distributed Ledger**: A synchronized database spread across multiple sites
- **Blocks**: Packages of data that contain transactions and a hash of the previous block
- **Hash**: A unique digital fingerprint that verifies block integrity
- **Consensus Mechanism**: How the network agrees on which blocks to add (e.g., Proof of Work, Proof of Stake)
- **Decentralization**: No single entity controls the entire network
- **Immutability**: Once recorded, data cannot be altered without network consensus
- **Public/Private Keys**: Cryptographic keys that secure transactions and prove ownership
- **Smart Contracts**: Self-executing agreements with terms written in code

## Example

```javascript
// Simplified example of a basic blockchain implementation
class Block {
  constructor(index, timestamp, data, previousHash = '') {
    this.index = index;
    this.timestamp = timestamp;
    this.data = data;
    this.previousHash = previousHash;
    this.hash = this.calculateHash();
  }

  calculateHash() {
    return SHA256(
      this.index + 
      this.previousHash + 
      this.timestamp + 
      JSON.stringify(this.data)
    ).toString();
  }
}

class Blockchain {
  constructor() {
    this.chain = [this.createGenesisBlock()];
  }

  createGenesisBlock() {
    return new Block(0, "01/01/2023", "Genesis Block", "0");
  }

  getLatestBlock() {
    return this.chain[this.chain.length - 1];
  }

  addBlock(newBlock) {
    newBlock.previousHash = this.getLatestBlock().hash;
    newBlock.hash = newBlock.calculateHash();
    this.chain.push(newBlock);
  }

  isChainValid() {
    for (let i = 1; i < this.chain.length; i++) {
      const currentBlock = this.chain[i];
      const previousBlock = this.chain[i - 1];

      if (currentBlock.hash !== currentBlock.calculateHash()) {
        return false;
      }

      if (currentBlock.previousHash !== previousBlock.hash) {
        return false;
      }
    }
    return true;
  }
}
