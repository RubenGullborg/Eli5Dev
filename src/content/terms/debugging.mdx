question: "What do you call the process of identifying and resolving issues in your code?"
hint: "This is an essential skill for developers to ensure their programs run smoothly."
analogy: "Think of debugging like being a detective. When something goes wrong, you investigate the clues (error messages) to find out what happened and fix it. Just like a detective solves a case, a developer solves coding problems."

## What is Debugging?

Debugging is the process of identifying and removing errors from computer software or hardware. It helps ensure that programs run as intended.

## Simple Analogy

Think of debugging like being a detective:
<br/>
- **Clues**: Error messages that help you find the problem.
- **Solving the Case**: Fixing the code to make it work.

## Key Concepts

- **Error Messages**: Information that helps identify what went wrong.
- **Breakpoints**: Points in the code where you can pause execution to inspect variables.

## Example

```javascript
// Debugging example
console.log("Value of x:", x); // Check the value of x
```
