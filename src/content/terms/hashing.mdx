title: "Hashing"
description: "A process that converts any input data into a fixed-size string of characters, which is typically a hexadecimal number."
question: "What cryptographic technique transforms data of any size into a fixed-length string that can be used to verify data integrity?"
hint: "It's commonly used for password storage, file verification, and data structures like hash tables."
analogy: "Hashing is like making a unique fingerprint for data. Just as each person has a unique fingerprint that can identify them without revealing what they look like, a hash function creates a unique 'digital fingerprint' of any data without storing the original data itself. If even one tiny detail of the original data changes (like changing a single letter in a document), the fingerprint becomes completely different. This makes hashing perfect for verifying if data has been tampered with or for securely storing passwords - you can check if a fingerprint matches without ever having to store or see the original data."

## What is Hashing?

Hashing is a process that takes any amount of data (like a password, file, or message) and creates a fixed-size string of characters that uniquely represents that data.

<br />
The output (called a hash or digest) looks like a random string of letters and numbers,
but it's actually a digital fingerprint of the original data.

## Simple Analogy

Hashing is like a magic meat grinder for information:

<br />
- You can put anything into it - a single word, an entire book, or even a huge video
file - No matter what you put in, what comes out is always the same size - You can't
reconstruct the original input just by looking at what came out - If you change even
the tiniest part of the input, what comes out looks completely different - If you
put in the same input twice, you'll get exactly the same output both times
<br />
An input might look like "Password123" before hashing, and after hashing it would
look like "59652de42af355d2de5cc604ea0546d1 eff4eddd10b242cf8cc19dec9be84f4b 050caff9c81c03a3227be125a9d88f75

## Common Uses

- **Password Storage**: Websites store hashes of passwords, not the passwords themselves
- **Digital Signatures**: Verifying who created or sent a document
- **Hash Tables**: Fast data lookup in programming
- **Blockchain**: Creating chains of blocks in cryptocurrencies

## Common Hashing Algorithms

- **MD5**: Fast but no longer secure for cryptographic purposes
- **SHA-256**: Widely used semi-secure hash algorithm
- **bcrypt**: Specifically designed for password hashing
- **Argon2**: Modern password hashing algorithm resistant to various attacks

## Key Properties of Good Hash Functions

- **Deterministic**: The same input always produces the same hash
- **Quick to Compute**: Calculating the hash is fast
- **Pre-image Resistant**: You can't work backwards from the hash to the original data
- **Collision Resistant**: It's extremely difficult to find two different inputs that produce the same hash
- **Avalanche Effect**: A small change in input causes a dramatic change in the output
