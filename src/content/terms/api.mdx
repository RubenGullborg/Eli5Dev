## What is an API?

An API (Application Programming Interface) is a set of rules and protocols that allows different software applications to communicate with each other.

## Simple Analogy

An API is like a waiter at a restaurant. You (the application) give the waiter (the API) your order (request), and the waiter goes to the kitchen (server/database), fetches your food (data), and brings it back to your table, without you needing to know how the kitchen works inside.

## Example

When you use a weather app on your phone, the app uses a weather API to request current weather data from an external server. The API handles the communication between the app and the weather data service.
