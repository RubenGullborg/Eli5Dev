question: "What is the name for a set of rules that allows different software applications to communicate with each other?"
hint: "Think of it as a middleman that helps different programs talk to each other."
analogy: "An API is like a waiter at a restaurant. You (the application) give the waiter (the API) your order (request), and the waiter goes to the kitchen (server/database), fetches your food (data), and brings it back to your table, without you needing to know how the kitchen works inside."

## What is an API?

An API (Application Programming Interface) is a set of rules and protocols that allows different software applications to communicate with each other.

## Simple Analogy

An API is like a waiter at a restaurant. You (the application) give the waiter (the API) your order (request), and the waiter goes to the kitchen (server/database), fetches your food (data), and brings it back to your table, without you needing to know how the kitchen works inside.

## Example

When you use a weather app on your phone, the app uses a weather API to request current weather data from an external server. The API handles the communication between the app and the weather data service.

## Code 

Below is a super simple example of what an API could be. In this case an object that exposes methods that allows you do some things.
<br/>
The fancy word for this is an “interface”. You don’t care how the methods are implemented or about the logic behind it, you just want to getData, writeData or doStuff.
<br/>
An api is a ready made tool, application, collection of tools that allow you do some things without having to worry about how that thing is done.
<br/>
```
class Api {
    constructor() {
        …
    }
    getData(x){}
    writeData(x, y) {}
    doStuff(z) {}
    …
}
```
