question: "How can apps automatically notify each other when something happens?"
hint: "This system lets apps send instant messages to each other when specific events occur, like when a new order is placed."
analogy: "Think of webhooks like a doorbell system. Without webhooks (polling), you'd have to keep opening your door every few minutes to check if anyone is there. With webhooks, you install a doorbell that automatically rings when someone arrives. The doorbell (webhook) sends a signal (notification) to you (your app) only when something specific happens (like someone arriving). This way, you don't waste time checking when nothing is happening, and you get notified instantly when something important occurs."

## What is a Webhook?

A webhook is a way for apps to automatically tell each other when something happens. Instead of one app constantly asking another app "Has anything changed?", the second app will automatically send a message when something important happens.

## Simple Analogy

Think of webhooks like a notification system for your smartphone:
<br/>
- **Traditional API (Polling)**: Like repeatedly checking your physical mailbox to see if you have any new mail. You have to manually look several times a day, wasting trips when there's nothing there.
<br/>
- **Webhooks (Event-Driven)**: Like signing up for text message notifications from your postal service. They automatically notify you the moment a package is delivered, so you only need to check your mailbox when you know something is there.

## Key Concepts

- **Event-Driven**: Webhooks are triggered by specific events (like a new order or payment)
- **HTTP Callbacks**: Webhooks send messages to a specific web address you provide
- **Payload**: The information sent about what happened
- **Endpoint**: The web address where webhook messages are sent
- **Authentication**: Ways to make sure the webhook messages are legitimate
- **Retry Logic**: What happens if a webhook message fails to deliver
