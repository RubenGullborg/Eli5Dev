title: "CDN"
description: "A Content Delivery Network is a network of distributed servers that deliver web content to users based on their geographic location to maximize speed and availability."
question: "What technology helps websites load faster by storing copies of content closer to users?"
hint: "This network of servers delivers content from the nearest location rather than from a distant central server."
analogy: "Think of a CDN like a chain of restaurants. Instead of having just one restaurant in New York that ships food worldwide, you have identical restaurants in cities around the world. When you order food, you get it from the nearest restaurant, not from New York. This makes delivery much faster and more reliable."

## What is a CDN?

A Content Delivery Network (CDN) is a geographically distributed network of servers that work together to provide fast delivery of internet content. CDNs store cached copies of website content in multiple locations around the world, so when a user requests a webpage, the content is delivered from the nearest server rather than from the original, potentially distant host server.

## Simple Analogy

Think of a CDN like a chain of restaurants:
<br/>
- **Without CDN**: Imagine having just one restaurant in New York that ships food worldwide. If you're in Tokyo, your order goes to New York, they prepare it, and ship it to Tokyo (slow, food gets cold).
<br/>
- **With CDN**: Instead, now imagine having identical restaurants in cities worldwide. When you order food, you get it from the nearest restaurant, not from New York (fast, fresh, and hot).
<br/>
Using a CDN has advantages such as:
<br/>
- **Faster service**: Get your content faster from the nearest server
- **Consistent quality**: Every server has identical content
- **Reliability**: If one server is busy or down, others remain available
- **Scaling capacity**: Local servers handle increased traffic without overwhelming the main server
