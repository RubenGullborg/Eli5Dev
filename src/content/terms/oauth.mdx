question: "A framework that lets an app use your information from another website without sharing your password."
hint: "This security system lets you give apps limited access to your data, like giving a valet a key that only opens your car but not your house."
analogy: "Think of OAuth like a hotel key card system. When you check into a hotel, you get a special key card that only opens your room. If you need the valet to park your car, you don't give them your room key. Instead, the hotel gives the valet a special valet key that only works for parking your car. This valet key can't open your room, only works for a limited time, and can be taken away without changing your room key. OAuth works the same way - it lets apps use your information from other websites (like Google or Facebook) without getting your actual password."

## What is OAuth?

OAuth is a way to let apps use your information from other websites without giving them your password. Instead of sharing your username and password, OAuth lets you give apps limited access to just the information they need, for a limited time.

## Simple Analogy

- **Think of OAuth like a hotel key card system:**:
  1. You check into a hotel (the website like Google or Facebook)
  2. The hotel verifies your identity once at check-in
  3. You get a special key card (access token) that only opens specific doors
  4. When a valet (third-party app) needs to park your car, you don't give them your room key
  5. Instead, the hotel gives the valet a limited-use valet key (specific token) that:
     - Only works for a specific purpose (parking your car)
     - Only works for a limited time (expiration)
     - Doesn't give access to your room (limited scope)
     - Can be revoked without changing your main key

## Key Concepts

- **Resource Owner**: You - the person who owns the data
- **Client**: The app that wants to use your data
- **Authorization Server**: The website that gives out the special keys (like Google)
- **Resource Server**: The website that has your data
- **Access Token**: The special key that lets the app use your data
- **Scope**: What the app is allowed to do with your data
- **Consent**: When you say "yes" to letting the app use your data
