title: "Web Accessibility"
description: "Making websites work for everyone, including people who use different ways to access the internet, like screen readers or keyboard navigation."
question: "How can we make websites work for everyone, no matter how they access the internet?"
hint: "This practice ensures websites are usable by people with different abilities and needs, like those who can't see or use a mouse."
analogy: "Think of web accessibility like making a building accessible to everyone. Just as a building needs ramps, elevators, and wide doorways for people who use wheelchairs, websites need special features for people who use different tools to access them. It's like having multiple ways to enter a building - some people might use the stairs, others might need an elevator, and some might need a ramp. Web accessibility ensures everyone can use the website in the way that works best for them."

## What is Web Accessibility?

Web accessibility means making websites that everyone can use, no matter how they access the internet. This includes people who:
<br/>
- Can't see and use screen readers
- Can't use a mouse and navigate with a keyboard
- Have trouble reading or understanding content
- Have difficulty hearing audio content

## Simple Analogy

Think of web accessibility like making a building accessible to everyone:

<br/>
- **Ramps and Elevators**: Like having alternative ways to navigate a website (keyboard navigation, screen readers)

- **Clear Signs**: Like having clear headings and labels on a website

- **Wide Doorways**: Like having text that can be made bigger or content that works on different screen sizes

- **Braille Signs**: Like having text descriptions for images

## Key Concepts

<br/>
- **WCAG Guidelines**: Standards for making websites accessible

- **Screen Readers**: Software that reads website content aloud

- **Keyboard Navigation**: Using only a keyboard to use a website

- **Alt Text**: Text descriptions for images

- **ARIA**: Special attributes that help screen readers understand website content

## Example

```html
<!-- Bad: Image without description -->
<img src="dog.jpg">

<!-- Good: Image with description -->
<img src="dog.jpg" alt="A brown dog playing with a red ball in a park">

<!-- Bad: Button without clear purpose -->
<button>Click here</button>

<!-- Good: Button with clear purpose -->
<button aria-label="Submit form">Submit</button>
```
