title: "REST API"
description: "A way for different computer programs to talk to each other over the internet, like a waiter taking your order at a restaurant and bringing back your food."
question: "A specific way that different computer programs can talk to each other over the internet?"
hint: "This system lets programs request information from each other using simple commands like 'get this' or 'send that'."
analogy: "Think of a REST API like a restaurant. The menu (API documentation) lists all the available dishes (data) you can order. The waiter (API) takes your order and communicates with the kitchen. When you want something, you tell the waiter what you want (make a request). The waiter brings back what you asked for (the response). Just like a restaurant has standard ways of ordering (like saying 'I'd like the pasta, please'), REST APIs have standard ways of requesting information (like 'GET /users' to get a list of users)."

## What is REST API?

A REST API is a way for different computer programs to talk to each other over the internet. It lets one program ask another program for information or send information, using simple commands like "get this" or "send that."

## Simple Analogy

Think of a REST API like a restaurant:
<br/>
- **Menu (API Documentation)**: Lists all available dishes (data) you can order
<br/>
- **Waiter (API)**: Takes your order and communicates with the kitchen
<br/>
- **Order Form (Request)**: How you specify what you want
  - Dish selection (URL/endpoint) - e.g., `/meals/pasta`
  - Special instructions (parameters) - e.g., "extra cheese"
  - Type of order (HTTP method):
    - **Viewing the menu (GET)**: Just retrieving information without changing anything
    - **Placing a new order (POST)**: Creating something new
    - **Modifying your order (PUT/PATCH)**: Changing something that exists
    - **Canceling your order (DELETE)**: Removing something
<br/>
- **Food delivery (Response)**: What comes back after your order is processed

## Key Concepts

- **Resources**: Things you can access via URLs (e.g., `/users`, `/products/123`)
- **HTTP Methods**: Standard operations on resources
  - GET: Get information
  - POST: Create something new
  - PUT/PATCH: Update something
  - DELETE: Remove something
- **Statelessness**: Each request contains all information needed to process it
- **Representation**: Resources can be shown in different formats (JSON, XML, etc.)
- **Status Codes**: Standard responses indicating success or failure (200 OK, 404 Not Found, etc.)
