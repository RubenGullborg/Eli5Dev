title: "REST API"
description: "Representational State Transfer API - a set of rules for building web services"
question: "What type of API uses standard HTTP methods like GET and POST to interact with web services?"
hint: "This architectural style is commonly used for web services and uses URLs to represent resources."
analogy: "Think of a REST API like a restaurant. The menu (API documentation) lists all the available dishes (data) you can order. The waiter (API) takes your order and communicates with the kitchen. When you want something, you tell the waiter what you want (make a request). The waiter brings back what you asked for (the response). Just like a restaurant has standard ways of ordering (like saying 'I'd like the pasta, please'), REST APIs have standard ways of requesting information (like 'GET /users' to get a list of users)."

## What is REST API?

A REST API is a way for computer programs to talk to each other over the internet using simple, standard methods. REST stands for "Representational State Transfer," which means it transfers representations (usually JSON or XML) of the state of resources (like users, products, or articles).
<br/>
It lets one program ask another program for information or send information, using simple commands like "get this" or "send that."

## Simple Analogy

Think of a REST API like a library system:
<br/>
Each book has a unique address on a shelf (URL for a resource) and there are standard ways to interact with books:
<br/>
  - Checking the catalog (GET - retrieve information)
  - Adding a new book to the collection (POST - create)
  - Replacing or editing a damaged book with a new copy (PUT - update)
  - Removing an outdated book (DELETE - remove)
<br/>
You don't need to know how the library organizes things internally, anyone who understands libraries can use any library, even in different cities

## Key Concepts

- **Resources**: Things you can access via URLs (e.g., `/users`, `/products/123`)
- **HTTP Methods**: Standard operations on resources
  - GET: Get information
  - POST: Create something new
  - PUT/PATCH: Update something
  - DELETE: Remove something
<br/>
- **Stateless**: Each request contains all information needed, so the server don't have to remember previous requests
- **Representation**: Resources can be shown in different formats (JSON, XML, etc.)
- **Status Codes**: Standard responses indicating success or failure (200 OK, 404 Not Found, etc.)
