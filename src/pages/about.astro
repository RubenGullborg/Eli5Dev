          Eli5Dev (Explain Like I'm 5 for Developers) is a resource designed to
          help new developers understand complex technical concepts through
          simple analogies and explanations.
        </p>

        <p>
          Our goal is to break down learning barriers by explaining technical
          concepts in a way that's easy to grasp, even for those just starting
          their journey in the development world.

          Why "Explain Like I'm 5"?
        </h2>

        <p>
          "Explain Like I'm 5" (ELI5) is a concept centered around explaining
          complex topics in such a simple way that even a child could
          understand. In the tech world, jargon and abstract concepts can be
          overwhelming for beginners. Using the ELI5 approach, we aim to make
          these concepts more accessible through:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>Simple, clear explanations without unnecessary jargon</li>
          <li>
            Relatable analogies connecting technical terms to everyday concepts
          </li>
          <li>Practical examples demonstrating the concepts in action</li>
        </ul>
